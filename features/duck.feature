Feature: Just a Duck
  As a Python Grakn Developer I need to be sure that the project structure works

  Scenario: Test package structure
    This is just a fake scenario to test the package
    Given I have a Duck called "Jack"
    When I squeeze the duck
    Then the response should be "Quack! I am Jack!"
