Feature: Grakn REST client

  As a developer,
  In order to modify and query a GRAKN.AI graph
  I want to be able to send queries and receive results
  to a running instance of the GRAKN engine
  via a REST client


  Scenario: Default HTTP parameters
    We need to make sure that a new client has the
    correct default parameters to connect to the GRAKN engine
    # TODO: Enter steps here

  Scenario: Changing HTTP parameters
    It must be possible to change parameters in order to connect
    to remote and user defined engines
    # TODO: Enter steps here

  Scenario: Sending a query
    We should be able to send plain graql queries to the user defined engine
    # TODO: Enter steps here

  Scenario: Storing responses
    The response to a query should be storable and usable in other contexts
    # TODO: Enter steps here
